💞️ About:
After working as a data analyst for Ab Inbev and graduating in Computer Engineering @UTFPR (Brazil) I took up an academic challenge and got a Masters and a Doctorate (PHD equivalent) degrees in Technology and Society, with a keen interest for Philosophy of Technology. I found in Machine Learning a perfect place to make all these previous experiences converge in all possibile dimensions. I'm passionate about being able to produce new things that help human beings and making them come into being and I intend to do that through Machine Learning. I'm particularly interested in the Computer Vision Field. I'm currently working as a researcher and ML/Computer Vision developer @LACTEC (Curitiba-Brazil). I've created this github to share what I find in this path with the community, and find out what else other people have built and discovered.
